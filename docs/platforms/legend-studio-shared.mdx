# Shared Public Instance of Legend Studio
FINOS hosts a shared instance of Legend Studio at [https://legend.finos.org/studio](https://legend.finos.org/studio). The shared instance of Legend Studio is provided free-of-charge and as-is. It is primarily intended to be used for shared modeling efforts conducted by FINOS members and other non-member community participants as part of [FINOS hosted projects or initiatives](https://landscape.finos.org/).

Learn about the projects that are currently leveraging the shared instance of Legend Studio in the "modeling initiatives" section of the [FINOS Landscape](https://landscape.finos.org/). The shared instance was also used by participants in the [FINOS Legend Studio pilot (April-September 2020)](https://www.finos.org/press/goldman-sachs-open-sources-its-data-modeling-platform-through-finos). 

Anyone is welcome to [request an account on the shared instance](https://www.finos.org/legend). Requests for accounts will be fulfilled based on FINOS staff availability as well as the rationale stated below for wanting an account and/or any connection between a request and the work of an ongoing FINOS project. Additional consideration will be also given to account requests from FINOS members.
