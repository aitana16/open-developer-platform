Please select from one of the following two options below ..

## 1. Slack Channel Request

Let us know if your FINOS Project / SIG needs a dedicated _**"public"**_ channel on https://finos-lf.slack.com/ for real-time, synchronous project team communications.

**Please note** : All FINOS Project and SIG channels in https://finos-lf.slack.com/ are _**"public"**_, unless explicitly stated why a _**"private"**_ channel is required.

## 2. GitHub Team Discussions Request

Let us know if your FINOS Project / SIG needs a [GitHub Team](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-teams) created in the [FINOS Organisation](https://github.com/finos/) to enable [GitHub Team Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-team-discussions). Information on GitHub Team Discussions for asynchronous team communication is found in the [Communications Section](https://odp.finos.org/docs/project-collaboration#conversations) of the ODP Microsite.
